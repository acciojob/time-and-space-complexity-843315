	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input (n) increases.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b>is a branch of algorithm analysis that focuses on how much memory an algorithm needs as a function of input size (n).</p>
